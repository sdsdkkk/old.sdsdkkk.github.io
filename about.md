(Vincencius) Edwin Tunggawan's blog on programming and related stuff. Edwin is a software engineer and computer hobbyist, and due to his laziness he ended up with sdsdkkk as his Twitter display name. The display name is kept like that ever since, and it's used in some other accounts of his.

He also has other blogs on programming and computer stuff:

* [echo $TITLE][sdsdkkk]
* [Twisted Cable][utwistedp]

But it seems that this blog will be used for longer posts on programming with lots of snippets, as the flexibility of Jekyll beats WordPress for a programmer.
