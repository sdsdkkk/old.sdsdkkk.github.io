A software engineer with some interest in security and some other stuff. Roams the Internet as sdsdkkk--it's just a string of random keystrokes without any kind of meaning.

Things I write here are mostly commentaries or description of something I do. For more seriously-written articles, see [Medium](https://medium.com/@sdsdkkk).

Tweets once in a while, see more on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sdsdkkk).

Reads books, sometimes randomly. Also a user of [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/sdsdkkk).

Sometimes does [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) challenges and writes walkthroughs. The list of walkthroughs are available [here](https://www.vulnhub.com/author/sdsdkkk,201/).

Formerly a software/security engineer at Bukalapak, currently a software engineer at Cermati.
